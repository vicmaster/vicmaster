### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on web development for many years, I'm a Director of Engineering at MagmaLabs.

I love building software for [magmalabs](https://www.magmalabs.io/), [writing](https://www.zazvick.com/), [speaking](https://speakerdeck.com/vicmaster), [On Air](https://twitter.com/Dia30_elpodcast), and [building communities](https://twitter.com/webdevtalksmx).
My favorite tool is Ruby on Rails, I also like dancing, playing music, traveling, photography, and currently learning about music production [My Music](https://soundcloud.com/zazvick).

:sparkles: I share technology [@zazvick](https://twitter.com/zazvick). Sometimes I share memes :nerd_face:
